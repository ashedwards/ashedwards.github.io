                Rewards often act as the sole feedback for Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems. This signal is surprisingly powerful. It can motivate agents to solve tasks without any further guidance for how to accomplish them. Nevertheless, rewards do not come for free, and are typically hand-engineered for each problem. Furthermore, rewards are often defined as a function of an agent’s state variables. These components have traditionally been tuned to the domain and include information such as the location of the agent or other objects in the world. The reward function then is inherently based on domain-specific representations. While such reward specifications can be sufficient enough to produce optimal behavior, more complex tasks might be difficult to express in this manner. Suppose a robot has a task of building origami figures. The environment would need to provide a reward each time the robot made a correct figure, thus requiring the program designer to define a notion of correctness for each desired configuration. Constructing a reward function for each model might become tedious and even difficult—-what should the inputs even be?
                <br>
                <br>
                Humans regularly exploit learning materials outside of the physical realm of a task, be it through diagrams, videos, text, and speech. For example, we might look at an image of a completed origami figure to determine if our own model is correct. My research describes similar approaches for presenting tasks to agents. In particular, I aim to develop methods for specifying perceptual goals both within and outside of the agent’s environment, and Perceptual Reward Functions (PRFs) that are derived from these goals. This will allow us to represent goals in settings where we can more easily find or construct solutions, without requiring us to modify the reward function when the task changes.
                My thesis aimed to show that employing perceptual goal specifications for goal-directed tasks: is as straightforward as specifying domain-specific rewards; is a more general representation for tasks; and equally enables task completion.

                In this paper, we introduce a novel form of a value function, Q(s, s' ), that expresses the utility of transitioning from a state s to a neighboring state s' and then acting optimally thereafter. In order to derive an optimal policy, we develop a novel forward dynamics model that learns to make next-state predictions that maximize Q(s, s' ). This formulation decouples actions from values while still learning off-policy. We highlight the benefits of this approach in terms of value function transfer, learning within redundant action spaces, and learning off-policy from state observations generated by sub-optimal or completely random policies.

                In this paper, we describe a novel approach to
                imitation learning that infers latent policies directly from state observations. We introduce a
                method that characterizes the causal effects of latent actions on observations while simultaneously
                predicting their likelihood. We then outline an
                action alignment procedure that leverages a small
                amount of environment interactions to determine
                a mapping between the latent and real-world actions. We show that this corrected labeling can
                be used for imitating the observed behavior, even
                though no expert actions are given. We evaluate our approach within classic control environments and a platform game and demonstrate that
                it performs better than standard approaches.

                Imitation by observation is an approach for learning from expert demonstrations that lack action information, such as videos. Recent approaches to this problem can be placed into two broad categories: training dynamics models that aim to predict the actions taken between states, and learning rewards or features for computing them for Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that learns values, rather than rewards, directly from observations. We show that by using values, we can significantly speed up RL by removing the need to bootstrap action-values, as compared to sparse-reward specifications.

                Goals for reinforcement learning problems are typically defined through hand-specified rewards. To design such problems, developers of learning algorithms must inherently be aware of what the task goals are, yet we often require agents to discover them on their own without any supervision beyond these sparse rewards. While much of the power of reinforcement learning derives from the concept that agents can learn with little guidance, this requirement greatly burdens the training process. If we relax this one restriction and endow the agent with knowledge of the reward function, and in particular of the goal, we can leverage backwards induction to accelerate training. To achieve this, we propose training a model to learn to take imagined reversal steps from known goal states. Rather than training an agent exclusively to determine how to reach a goal while moving forwards in time, our approach travels backwards to jointly predict how we got there. We evaluate our work in Gridworld and Towers of Hanoi and empirically demonstrate that it yields better performance than standard DDQN.

                A major bottleneck for developing general reinforcement learning agents is determining rewards that will yield desirable behaviors under various circumstances. We introduce a general mechanism for automatically specifying meaningful behaviors from raw pixels. In particular, we train a generative adversarial network to produce short sub-goals represented through motion templates. We demonstrate that this approach generates visually meaningful behaviors in unknown environments with novel agents and describe how these motions can be used to train reinforcement learning agents.

                In reinforcement learning, we often define goals by specifying rewards within desirable states. One problem with this approach is that we typically need to redefine the rewards each time the goal changes, which often requires some understanding of the solution in the agents environment. When humans are learning to complete tasks, we regularly utilize alternative sources that guide our understanding of the problem. Such task representations allow one to specify goals on their own terms, thus providing specifications that can be appropriately interpreted across various environments. This motivates our own work, in which we represent goals in environments that are different from the agents. We introduce Cross-Domain Perceptual Reward (CDPR) functions, learned rewards that represent the visual similarity between an agents state and a cross-domain goal image. We report results for learning the CDPRs with a deep neural network and using them to solve two tasks with deep reinforcement learning.

                Reinforcement learning problems are often described
                through rewards that indicate if an agent
                has completed some task. This specification can
                yield desirable behavior, however many problems
                are difficult to specify in this manner, as one often
                needs to know the proper configuration for the
                agent. When humans are learning to solve tasks,
                we often learn from visual instructions composed
                of images or videos. Such representations motivate
                our development of Perceptual Reward Functions,
                which provide a mechanism for creating visual task
                descriptions. We show that this approach allows an
                agent to learn from rewards that are based on raw
                pixels rather than internal parameters.

                Reward engineering is the problem of expressing a target task for an agent in the form of rewards for a Markov decision process.
                To be useful for learning, it is important that these encodings be robust to structural changes in the underlying domain; that is, the
                specification remain unchanged for any domain in some target class. We identify problems that are difficult to express robustly via the
                standard model of discounted rewards. In response, we examine the idea of decomposing a reward function into separate components,
                each with its own discount factor. We describe a method for finding robust parameters through the concept of task engineering, which
                additionally modifies the discount factors. We present a method for optimizing behavior in this setting and show that it could provide
                a more robust language than standard approaches.

                 Groups of contacts created within mobile phone interfaces enable users to easily interact with a specific subset of
                 people from their social networks. However, manually organizing contacts may become difficult for users as their
                 contact lists grow. We introduce a method that attempts to determine a user’s mobile groups by interactively
                 clustering contacts from their cell phone. We will show that by actively querying the user on likely mislabeled
                 contacts, and then re-clustering the contacts after a correct label is received, we reduce the number of contacts that
                 must be manually labeled.

                 Context Messages is a system that allows the user to send
                 messages when they are most relevant to the receiver’s context.
                 The context could be based on location, weather, time,
                 availability, activities being performed, traffic, etc. We describe
                 an implementation of the system using some of these
                 contexts on the Google Glass platform. We conducted user
                 studies to evaluate the easy of use and learnability of the system.
                 The system received an average score of 6.3 out of a 7
                 point Likert scale in terms of learnabilty with a small variation
                 of 0.23 points between users. From the user study, we
                 uncovered concerns of privacy and of false triggering of menu
                 prompts. We introduce a privacy web interface and redesign
                 our menu system to address these concerns.

                 Robotic assistants are becoming increasingly useful
                 in many different domains, such as in the healthcare industry
                 for assisting with elderly or disabled patients, in outer space for
                 scientific exploration purposes, in the home for personal
                 assistance, and in an office setting. If robots are to act as
                 assistants or companions to humans, a human should be able to
                 ask a robot to provide support by performing some higher-level
                 task, just as they would ask another human, and the robot
                 should be able to respond accordingly. Our project seeks to
                 build an intelligent reasoning and planning framework using a
                 semantic map as the underlying knowledge representation, and
                 integrates human-robot interaction in order to minimize the
                 uncertainty of the robot. A robot assistant is given a higherlevel
                 task to achieve by a human. We explore how a semantic
                 map may be used, along with human feedback, in order to help
                 the robot interpret its task, reason about how to achieve the
                 task in the given environment, and subsequently plan and
                 execute the task effectively. The robot re-plans dynamically as
                 it acquires new information.

                 Twitter is a popular social network where users frequently post short
                 messages and engage in conversations with other users. This provides a
                 large amount of information about the user’s interests and social
                 preferences and has been a lucrative research area. In particular, research
                 in Social Search, the act of posing questions to and receiving answers from
                 one’s social network, has gained interest. However, the large database of
                 information that results from users’ Twitter interactions is not presently
                 leveraged for aiding in social search. In this paper, we introduce CoBot, a
                 novel social assistant and data mining agent for Twitter. CoBot gathers
                 social statistics about users and their followers, allows them to query about
                 their social interactions, and assists with Social Search by recommending
                 knowledgeable followers and providing relevant tweets. By using social
                 statistics about users and learning from feedback about recommendations,
                 CoBot is more amenable to ‘social queries’ than conventional search
                 engines.

                 Software and user interfaces are designed with
                 the preferences of the end-users in mind.
                 However, these modules are not easily
                 modified. Users often think of changes to
                 products long before they are implemented,
                 but changing these products requires constant
                 updates and resources.
                 We propose a method for creating an agent
                 that is capable of learning and adapting from
                 interactions with an end user. In our approach,
                 we use Interactive Reinforcement Learning to
                 train a bipedal agent to learn how to run and
                 remain balanced. This will give the user a
                 unique experience with the game, while
                 allowing the agent to adapt to the users
                 preferences.
